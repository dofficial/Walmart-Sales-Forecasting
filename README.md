# 🛒 Walmart Sales Forecasting  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project investigates **Walmart's nationwide retail performance** using **time series analysis** of weekly sales data. By leveraging **Python’s advanced libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Statsmodels, Prophet, etc.)**, the analysis uncovers:  
- Temporal sales patterns  
- Seasonal demand cycles  
- Regional performance differences  
- The impact of holidays & macroeconomic variables  

This empowers **strategic decision-making** in **inventory planning, marketing, and demand forecasting**.

## 🔍 Key Business Questions Answered  

1. What are the **long-term sales trends** across Walmart stores?  
2. How do **holidays and seasonal effects** influence sales?  
3. Which **stores and regions** contribute the most revenue?  
4. What are the **week-over-week sales changes** and growth drivers?  
5. How can Walmart leverage **forecasting** to plan demand and inventory better?

## 📊 Insights  

- **Seasonality:** Sales clearly spike during holidays (up to **30% higher** than normal).  
- **Top Stores:** A few high-performing stores consistently drive most of the revenue.  
- **Rolling Averages:** Long-term trends show periods of growth and slight decline phases.  
- **Variability Across Stores:** Distribution plots reveal consumer behavior differences by location.  
- **Week-over-Week Changes:** Waterfall charts map incremental increases/decreases in sales.

## 💡 Recommendations  

✔️ **Focus inventory & marketing** on high-performing stores & regions.  
✔️ Use **rolling averages & exponential smoothing** for **short-term demand planning**.  
✔️ Align **promotions & supply chain** with holiday/seasonal peaks.  
✔️ Incorporate **external economic indicators** (Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment) for predictive accuracy.  
✔️ Explore **advanced forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM)** for **long-term planning**.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Future Scope  

- Data does not include **product-level granularity**.  
- Limited external economic features (only CPI, Fuel Price, Unemployment).  
- Future work:  
  - Integrating **macroeconomic indicators** (GDP, inflation).  
  - Applying **ML/DL models** (XGBoost, LSTM) for demand forecasting.  
  - Creating **Power BI dashboards** for interactive business intelligence.
